This repository contains a fully reproducible workflow for assembling species occurrence data, integrating trait and environmental information, preparing spatial predictions, fitting statistical models, and quantifying biodiversity loss across spatial scales. The pipeline is organized into sequential modules, each stored in its own directory, that transform raw inputs into standardized datasets, generate model-ready structures, run GLMM and Bayesian abundance models, produce spatial predictions under forest and pasture scenarios, and compute biodiversity metrics across multiple posterior draws.

Each step can be executed independently. Intermediate objects are written to disk, allowing users to rerun specific stages without regenerating the full pipeline. All scripts list their package dependencies and follow consistent naming conventions to ensure transparency and reproducibility.
