This repository contains a fully reproducible workflow for assembling species occurrence data, integrating trait and environmental information, preparing spatial predictions, fitting models, and quantifying biodiversity loss across spatial scales. The code is organized into sequential modules that process raw data into standardized datasets, generate model-ready inputs, run statistical models, produce spatial predictions, and compute biodiversity metrics from multiple posterior draws.

The repository is structured so that each step can be executed independently. Intermediate objects are saved to disk, allowing for efficient re-runs of specific stages without having to regenerate the entire pipeline. All scripts list their package dependencies and follow consistent naming conventions to ensure transparency and reproducibility.
